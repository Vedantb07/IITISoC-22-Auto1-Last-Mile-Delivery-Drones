**Description:** _TATA 1mg_ is a pharmaceutical company that
delivers medicines at the doorstep via their courier
executives. Delivery drones can achieve the same task with a
fraction of the cost, especially since the payload is
minimal. An optimised delivery system should be ideated for
a drone fleet to plan out the delivery providing the routing
and mission-path planning.

**Specifications:**
- The drone environment from the warehouse to the
doorstep will be simulated. There may be multiple
houses in a locality for which the trips need to be
planned.
- The simulation should also log major events with
individual timings so that the performance of the whole
process can be analysed.
- Brownie points: Solving the problem involving the
constraint of limited battery time of the drone
